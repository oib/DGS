# German Sign Language (DGS) Learning Website - Roadmap & Progress

## 🎉 **PROJECT STATUS: COMPLETE**

The DGS learning platform has been successfully implemented and deployed. All core features are functional and the platform contains 926 comprehensive DGS signs across 10 learning levels.

## Project Overview
This project successfully created an interactive web platform for learning German Sign Language (Deutsche Gebärdensprache, DGS). The website provides comprehensive vocabulary, interactive tests, structured lessons, and learning progression to help users learn DGS effectively.

## ✅ **Actual Technology Stack (Implemented)**
- **Frontend**: Next.js 13+ with TypeScript and App Router
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- **Database**: SQLite with Prisma ORM (simplified from planned PostgreSQL)
